# Assistant Coach - Esports Analytics Platform

A data-driven coaching assistant that transforms raw esports match data into actionable insights, connecting individual player performance patterns to team-level strategic outcomes in near-real-time.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Authoritative** - The platform should feel like a trusted strategic advisor, presenting complex analytics with confidence and clarity
2. **Surgical** - Every insight should be precise and actionable, cutting through noise to reveal meaningful patterns that drive decision-making
3. **Dynamic** - The interface should feel alive with data, using motion and visual hierarchy to guide attention to the most critical insights

**Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality, likely with multiple views)
This is a sophisticated analytics platform that requires multiple interconnected views (player analysis, match review, strategic insights), advanced data processing, AI-powered pattern recognition, and rich data visualizations. It goes beyond simple CRUD operations to deliver intelligent coaching recommendations based on multi-dimensional data analysis.

## Essential Features
